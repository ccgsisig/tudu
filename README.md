## This React-based todo app is styled using HTML and CSS and provides various functionalities for managing tasks. Here's an overview of its features:

* Adding a Task: Users can effortlessly add a new task by entering the task details in the provided input field and then clicking the "Add" button.

* Local Storage Integration: To ensure task data persistence, the app utilizes the browser's local storage. This means that all tasks added by the user will be saved locally, even if they refresh the page or close the browser.

* Completing a Task: Users can mark a task as completed by simply clicking the checkbox next to the task. Once marked as completed, the task text will be displayed with a striking strike-through effect, making it visually distinguishable from the remaining tasks.

* Deleting a Task: The app allows users to remove a task from the list by clicking the "Delete" button next to the specific task. When the user deletes a task, it will be removed from both the displayed list and local storage.
